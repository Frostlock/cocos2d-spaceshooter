## Introduction
This is a small spaceshooter game written in python.
Some of the game mechanics and a lot of the graphics and sounds are based on the great game Subspace.

## Requirements

## Credits

* **Cocos2d (the python version)**   
  Special thanks to whoever wrote the balldrive_toy_game.py example :-)

* **Subspace**  
  As a tribute and because of reasons I used a lot of graphics and sounds from a game called Subspace. I'm not sure who currently owns the copyright on these, I found them on the web.  
  Source of note are two other subspace-like projects:
